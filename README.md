Your smart assistant that handles tasks and opens your favorite apps instantly—just say the word!
Shadow Assistant is a lightweight, intelligent, and fully customizable AI-powered voice assistant designed to work seamlessly in the background. It wakes up with the custom wake word "Shadow", responds only to voice commands, and performs everyday tasks like opening or closing applications, managing tasks, setting reminders, and providing real-time assistance — all while staying minimal on system resources. Shadow combines offline reliability with online intelligence, using a hybrid model of free APIs and an offline fallback to ensure smooth performance anytime. With a sleek GUI built on ttkbootstrap, Shadow not only listens and speaks but also helps track progress, motivate you, and keep you focused on your goals.
